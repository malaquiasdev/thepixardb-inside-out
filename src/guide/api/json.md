# JSON

The only format supported by us is JSON. This means there are some notable semantics to how you consume it.

This doc will include a short overview of the capabilities, but you can consult the <a href="https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/#:~:text=can%20consult%20the-,JSON%3AAPI%20Specification,-for%20more%20information" target="_blank">JSON:API Specification</a>
for more information.

You can be more specific about the data you want to retrieve by using URL parameters.
