# About us

## Who we are

We are an open-source metadata aggregation engine for the best movie componay of the world. We are fans of the Pixar Animation Studios.

Our main goal is to have the best core metadata information to provide a universal view, along with ingesting individual data from others providers
to enrich our dataset and be an unique API and one click to go.

We have some benefits like:

- Strict guidelines to ensure consistently high quality data across datasets, categories and regions.
- Our data is multi language.
- The datasets contains movies information like rating, runtime, cast and crew. Celebrity information like primary Name, gender, birthplace, and awards and pictures.
